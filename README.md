# Android-App---Uni-Events-and-Activites-App
This project was for my Mobile Technologies Unit. It involved using Android Studio and Java to develop a mobile app which you could add events and activites related to the University of Canberra and display them on a campus map (Google Maps), these activites then got uploaded to a Google Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Storage. The app can also generate routes from the users location to the activites location. For this project I achieved a mark of 28.5/30 For more information regarding the tasks, please read MT_Assignment_2024.pdf.
